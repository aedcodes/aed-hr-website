Hi! I’m AnnE Diemer (she/her) — and yes, my doctor parents made my initials match the automated external defibrillator. But 8+ years into my career in Human Resources, I’ve learned that sometimes
***<p style="text-align: center;"> an external source of energy might be just what you need to get things running more smoothly. </p>***


<h4 style="text-align: center;"> And that’s when you reach out to me! </h4>

------

My focus is always on doing people-centered work — prioritizing the HUMAN in HR. I approach HR through a lens that holds contradictions: How do we build great workplaces while also questioning capitalist systems? How can we work efficiently and move quickly while also prioritizing ourselves and each other as humans? There are no easy answers to these questions, but I’m going to keep asking them… because that’s the future of work.

When I’m not problem-solving within organizations, you can find me crocheting while watching Survivor or trying out a new restaurant with my partner.
