> AnnE quickly became an indispensable force in our organization, winning the trust of both senior leadership and staff at all levels of the organization. She brought patience, diligence, compassion, candor, and confidence to her work and the relationships she built. She helped facilitate challenging conversations, surface anxieties, and resolve tensions by being accessible and bringing innovations to our organizational culture. From “Office Hours” to creating an organizational values “Baton Hand-off” each week, AnnE had a talent for developing practical ways to inculcate trust-building adaptions into the week-to-week life of the organization.

> AnnE consistently demonstrated an unyielding passion for making our office environment a more inclusive, empathetic, and secure environment to be in. AnnE's ability to build deep trust from every level of our organization and offer resilient bridges when there were fragile divides was indispensable. AnnE’s commitment to a more just and equitable society is deep, sustained, and unquestioned.

> As part of my role as Site Lead for Stripe Seattle, I worked closely with AnnE. The office was the fastest growing Stripe location and we scaled from a single person to over 700 people in 4 years. 
>
>AnnE was instrumental in helping make that office a success through her cross-company efforts in recruiting, recruiting operations, internal communications, and inclusion efforts. In particular, AnnE had significant impact on this office (and the company as a whole) through the work she did to design, introduce, run, and iterate on a Candidate Review process. AnnE was also instrumental in Stripe's university recruiting and diversity recruiting initiatives.

> When I started a new position in the heart of the pandemic, AnnE was the one to steer my onboarding process and make it one of the most thorough and smooth onboarding processes I have experienced. She helped me understand expectations and goals quickly and clearly, while simultaneously ensuring that the resources and opportunities I needed to fully inhabit my role were easily accessible. 
>
> AnnE was also the driving force in making me feel connected to my work community. Her creativity and help in providing opportunities for me to spark and build relationships, while still encouraging me to do so at my own pace, meant that I quickly felt settled as a part of the team. 
>
> My onboarding process with AnnE was fantastic, and I would happily recommend her to any organization looking to improve its onboarding process.

> HR often feels like a corporate source for corrective action. But, working with AnnE felt like a partnership in the many uphill battles I navigated from hiring, performance evaluations and professional development for my team.
