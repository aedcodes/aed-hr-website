# Recruiting
Hiring the right people makes all the difference. Let’s work together to ensure you’re setting your candidates (and your interviewing team) up for success!

#### What I can help with:
- Training your interviewers to evaluate consistently and create great candidate experiences
- Crafting Job Descriptions that are inclusive, practical, and authentic to your organization
- Creating rubrics to help you select the right candidate for the position, while actively mitigating biases
- Designing interview questions to ensure you’re really getting to know the candidates

# Onboarding
A structured introduction to your organization determines how well new hires can do their jobs — and how long they will stay. Let’s work together to review your process and find ways we can continue to improve the experience!

#### What I can help with:
- Identifying the principles that will guide your onboarding process. (How should people feel when they join your organization?)
- Prioritizing what they must know right away, and creating opportunities to learn the rest with time
- Building organizational culture and interpersonal connection into your onboarding process

# Employee Engagement
Do you have a pulse on how your organization is doing? Are people energized by their work? Do they feel connected to each other and your mission? Let’s work together to answer these questions and create a place where people want to — and can — do their best work.

#### What I can help with:
- Designing and implementing an engagement survey that will help you assess key areas
- Interviewing staff in focus groups or individually to better identify areas of improvement
- Brainstorming, planning, and/or facilitating engagement activities to improve staff morale and connection


# Performance
Often, performance systems feel like an intimidating mystery to staff. Let’s work together to reframe performance as a transparent opportunity to identify areas of strength and growth that will help your employees along their career paths.

#### What I can help with:
- Defining the evaluation categories relevant to your organization
- Partnering with managers and department leads to pinpoint specifics for their work
- Creating a performance timeline and training plan
- Training managers to give feedback that aligns with their management style and their teams’ needs
