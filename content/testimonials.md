> AnnE quickly became an indispensable force in our organization, winning the trust of both senior leadership and staff at all levels of the organization. She brought patience, diligence, compassion, candor, and confidence to her work and the relationships she built. She helped facilitate challenging conversations, surface anxieties, and resolve tensions by being accessible and bringing innovations to our organizational culture. From “Office Hours” to creating an organizational values “Baton Hand-off” each week, AnnE had a talent for developing practical ways to inculcate trust-building adaptions into the week-to-week life of the organization.
